          October 20, 2015
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>It’s been a year since we started our startup, <a href="http://camva.ir">camva</a> a persian website builder with my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hadifarnoud">Hadi Farnoud</a>, I decided to write about our successfull partnership.</p>

<p>I want to describe our story as technical cofounder. Hadi is not a full-technical guy and he is expert in bussiness and marketing. In the begining, I thought this is not cool that my co-founder is not a developer he is not coding like me and only do some shit like business plan or go to market stategy.</p>

<p>I felt like that until after launch things changed and I figured out how much a none technical co-founder is good for a startup’s success. Actually, programmers and technical guys can’t understand how much they need a bussiness oriented partner for their startup and they often fail in early stages because of that.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-wish-for">What do you wish for?</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the traits that business cofounders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Co-founder material”</li>
  <li>Good development skills</li>
  <li>Matching personality and other traits</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="co-founder-material">1. “Co-founder material”</h3>
<p>Your co-founder needs to be good at things other than coding. he will need to come to meetings with customers &amp; investors. he’ll have a team to hire and manage. he’ll write blogs, site texts &amp; give you feedback on your writings.</p>

<p>Most importantly, you and him together will determine the strategy of your company. Entrepreneurship, we feel, is about quickly recognizing opportunities, unique advantages and avoidable obstacles. Our main criteria is to what extend a co-founder can brainstorm and be a genuine sparring partner.</p>

<h3 id="some-development-skills">2. Some development skills</h3>
<p>It is really helping if your cofounder understands code. You may not want a professional developer as a cofounder. If he’s good in coding, he might end up helping you with technical stuff and he may not be good on business side of things. It is so important.</p>

<h3 id="personality-and-other-traits">3. Personality and other traits</h3>
<p>If you’re going to be working together 80 hours a week for the next 4 years, you better get along or at least be able to communicate professionally.</p>

<p>There are many things to consider in this category:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introvert vs extrovert</li>
  <li>Outspoken religious or political views</li>
  <li>How you both handle conflict</li>
  <li>Personal grooming, body odor, etc</li>
  <li>And all the things that definitely DO NOT matter, but, sadly, are often taken into consideration (attractiveness, gender, race, hair color, accent, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>So these were important reasons to not look for a technical co-founder if you’re a technical guy yourself. you need a bussiness cofounder that you trust in his/her skills. It is important for both of you to trust each other’s abilities and focus on your own work.</p>
